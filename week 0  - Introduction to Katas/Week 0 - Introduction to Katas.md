There are no empty arrays.

Find the number that appears once.

output = 1
```

```
input = [4,2,1,2,1]
output = 4
```

## Problem 2

Given an array of interger numbers, find if there are any duplicates.

The function should return true if any value appears twice

```
input = [1,1,6,8,3,8]

```
```
input = [1,6,9,4,2]
output = false
```
